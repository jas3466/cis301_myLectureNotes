Julie Thornton.

What is this class?
- logical reasoning (basics, then puzzles)
- proofs (why?)
- reasoning about code
    - analyzing what we know
    - identifying equivalent programs
    - simplifying programs
- basics of proving correctness of programs (why?)

HW 1 - due Tues Jan 23

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Taking a step back...what is logic?

- analysis of an argument according to a set of rules
- given a set of premises (and sometimes a conclusion)


- we determine a valid conclusion when we assume
all the premises are true


Note that the premises might make no sense!

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Premise 1: If a person wears a red shirt, then they don’t
    like pizza.
Premise 2: Fred is wearing a red shirt.

Conclusion: Fred doesn’t like pizza.

--> Is this a valid argument?




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Logical Arguments with ”OR”

- can be ambiguous! Why?

I order fries or I order chips.

"or" can be inclusive or exclusive


- in English, how do we interpret "or"?



- in programming?




"Or" in THIS class:



Premise 1: I'll fold the laundry or I'll do the dishes.
Premise 2: I don't fold the laundry.

--> What can I conclude?




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

num = 5;
if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {
    statement;
}



Suppose we know "statement" is executed
--> What can we conclude?






/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

x = 9;
if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {
    if (num > 2) {
        statement;
    }
}



Suppose we know "statement" is executed
--> What can we conclude?


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What rule are we seeing with an ”or” statement,
where we know that one of the statements is NOT true?





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Logical Arguments with ”IF/THEN” (aka "implies" -> )

If it is raining, then I will get wet.
It is raining.

--> What can I conclude?





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

When we have an ”if/then” statement,
and we know that the ”if” part is true?

    ...what can we always conclude?





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If I don’t hear my alarm, then I will be late for class.
I am late for class.

--> What can I conclude?






/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If I don’t hear my alarm, then I will be late for class.
I hear my alarm.

--> What can I conclude?






/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If I don’t hear my alarm, then I will be late for class.

--> Can you think of another way to phrase this promise?

--> What do we know if we AREN'T late?




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {

    y = 17;
}

--> suppose y is 17 here. What do we know?



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

y = 10;

if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {

    y = 17;
}

--> suppose y is 17 here. Can we conclude anything now?


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if (num < 4 || x >= 10) {

    y = 17;
}

--> suppose y is NOT 17 here. What do we know?


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Logic puzzles.

The puzzles in this lecture are all either from or inspired by:
”What is the Name of This Book?”, by Raymond Smullyan

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The first puzzles involve the island of Knights and Knaves.
Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.

Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Who can say, "I'm a knave"?

Can a knight?
Can a knave?





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You see two inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

What are Ava and Bob?




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You see two different inhabitants, Eve and Fred.

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

What are Eve and Fred?

(what does the "or" mean? INCLUSIVE)



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days.”
Unicorn says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days, too.”

What day is it?






/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

You don’t know which is which.

You see both of them together.

Another Tweedledee and Tweedledum (same rules).

First twin: Today is Monday or Wednesday
Second twin: Today is Monday or Sunday

What day of the week is it?

(what kind of OR?)




/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don’t know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.

(one is lying, one is telling the truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle.”

The second one says: ”I'm Tweedledee!”

Who gets the rattle?
