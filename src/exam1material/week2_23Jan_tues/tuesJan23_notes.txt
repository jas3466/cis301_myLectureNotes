You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, “Bill would tell you that I am a knave.”

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?

How could we rewrite/simplify each statement?

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."


Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."


Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."



When is Cheryl's birthday? .
